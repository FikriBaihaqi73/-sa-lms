# Attendance and Teaching Journals API

Both features use JSON requests and return `{ "status", "message", "data", "code" }`.

## Attendances

| Method | URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/attendances` | List active attendance records. |
| GET | `/attendances/:id` | Get one record. |
| POST | `/attendances` | Create a record. |
| PATCH | `/attendances/:id` | Update a record. |
| DELETE | `/attendances/:id` | Soft-delete a record. |

Send `Content-Type: application/json`. Create example:

```json
{
  "schedule_id": "b3ecbb44-7a11-4ebb-b8ff-9001c20b6721",
  "student_id": "6e278a13-a4ed-4d23-9d70-9ad9746b436a",
  "attendance_status_id": "218734a3-e3f2-4791-b6c5-04b8ef9b1ef7",
  "attendance_date": "2026-09-10T00:00:00.000Z",
  "notes": "Present on time"
}
```

The three IDs are required; the date and notes are optional. The schedule, student, and attendance status must exist. One active record is allowed for each schedule, student, and supplied date. A duplicate returns HTTP 409; missing related data or an unknown ID returns HTTP 404. Zod validation returns field-specific HTTP 400 errors.

## Teaching journals

| Method | URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/teaching-journals` | List active journals. |
| GET | `/teaching-journals/:id` | Get one journal. |
| POST | `/teaching-journals` | Create a journal. |
| PATCH | `/teaching-journals/:id` | Update a journal. |
| DELETE | `/teaching-journals/:id` | Soft-delete a journal. |

Create example:

```json
{
  "schedule_id": "b3ecbb44-7a11-4ebb-b8ff-9001c20b6721",
  "meeting_number": 1,
  "journal_date": "2026-09-10T00:00:00.000Z",
  "topic": "Introduction to Algebra",
  "material": "Variables and expressions",
  "notes": "Class completed as planned"
}
```

Only `schedule_id` is required. `meeting_number` must be an integer of at least 1, and `topic` accepts at most 255 characters. The schedule must exist; otherwise the API returns HTTP 404. All fields in PATCH are optional.

## Response examples

Successful create returns HTTP 201:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Attendance created successfully",
  "data": { "id": "...", "schedule_id": "...", "student_id": "..." },
  "code": 201
}
```

A client can refresh the relevant list after POST, PATCH, or DELETE. DELETE responds with `data: { "success": true, "id": "..." }`; deleted records are omitted from later GET results.
